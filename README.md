# gmail_delete

This is a simple program that will delete all emails that meet a certain criteria from your gmail account.


To run the program you need to edit query in

if __name__ == '__main__':
    query = ''
    main(query)
    
and then run from idle. ( I could not make it work from command line becaues it kept saying that httplib2 could not be found.
